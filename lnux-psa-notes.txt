#####################################################
Why Should a developer or devops engineer learn linux
#####################################################
-> Linux is the backbone of modern IT infrastructure, and learning it provides a competitive edge for developers and DevOps engineers.
-> Most Servers Run on Linux
-> Popular DevOps tools like Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, Terraform, and Jenkins run seamlessly on Linux.
-> Major cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP) extensively use Linux-based VMs and services
-> Linux Servers are highly Secure
-> Performance 

############################
Linux Operating System (OS)
############################

-> Linux is a community-driven OS, not owned by any single company.

-> Linux is free and open-source, allowing customization and flexibility.

-> Linux is highly secure, eliminating the need for antivirus software.

-> Linux is primarily CLI-based (Command Line Interface), offering powerful control over the system.

-> Linux is widely used in businesses for efficient server management and enterprise solutions.

############################
Linux History
############################

-> Linux OS was developed by Linus Torvalds.

-> Linus Torvalds identified several limitations and challenges in the Unix OS.

-> He discovered an OS that aligned with his vision, known as Minix OS.

-> Using Minix OS as a reference, he modified its code and introduced a new operating system—Linux OS.

-> The name Linux comes from: (Li)nus + Mi(nux) = Linux.

#############################
Linux Distributions
#############################

​Linus Torvalds made the Linux OS source code freely available to the public. Various companies and communities have since modified this source code to meet their specific requirements, releasing their own versions known as Linux distributions or flavors. As of now, there are over 600 active Linux distributions in the market. ​
TrueList

Examples include:

a. Amazon Linux​
b. Ubuntu​
c. Red Hat​
d. Debian​
e. Kali​
f. Fedora​

Each of these distributions offers unique features and caters to different user needs, contributing to the rich diversity of the Linux ecosystem.

#########################
Text Editors in Linux
#########################

-> **vi (Visual Editor)** is the default text editor in Linux systems.  

-> Using the `vi` command, we can create new files and edit existing ones.  

-> The `vi` editor operates in **three modes**:  

    1) **Command Mode** – Opens a file (default mode).  
       Example: vi <filename>  

    2) **Insert Mode** – Enables text editing.  
       - Press **'i'** on the keyboard to enter insert mode.  

    3) **Escape Mode** – Exits insert mode.  
       - Press **'Esc'** on the keyboard to return to command mode.  

    ## **Save changes and exit** → `:wq`  
    ## **Exit without saving changes** → `:q!`  

**Note:** If the specified file exists, `vi` will open it. If not, `vi` will create a new file and open it.

#############################  
File Creation Commands  
#############################  

touch : Create an empty file  
cat   : Create a file and add data  
cp    : Copy content from one file to another (cp t1.txt t2.txt)  
vi    : Create and open a file for editing (vi t3.txt) 

###########################  
Reading File Data  
###########################  

cat   : Display file content from top to bottom  
tac   : Display file content from bottom to top  
head  : Show the first 10 lines of a file  
tail  : Show the last 10 lines of a file  
vi    : Open a file for viewing or editing  

###############
SED Command  
###############  

=> **SED** stands for **Stream Editor**  

=> **SED** is used for text processing (substituting, deleting, printing, inserting).  

=> It allows modifications to a file **without opening it**.  

=> **SED** is a powerful command in Linux.  

# **Substituting Text**  
- Replace the **first occurrence** of "linux" with "unix"  
  sed 's/linux/unix/' data.txt  

- Replace the **second occurrence** of "linux" with "unix"  
  sed 's/linux/unix/2' data.txt  

- Replace the **third occurrence** of "linux" with "unix"  
  sed 's/linux/unix/3' data.txt  

- Replace **all occurrences** of "linux" with "unix"  
  sed 's/linux/unix/g' data.txt  

- Substitute and **save changes** in the original file  
  sed -i 's/linux/unix/g' data.txt  

# **Deleting Lines**  
- Delete the **first line** of a file  
  sed -i '1d' data.txt  

- Delete the **fourth line** of a file  
  sed -i '4d' data.txt  

- Delete the **last line** of a file  
  sed -i '$d' data.txt  

- Delete data from **nth line to the last line**  
  sed -i 'n,$d' data.txt  
  *(Replace `n` with a line number)*  

- Delete data from **5th line to 15th line**  
  sed -i '5,15d' data.txt  

# **Printing Specific Lines**  
- Print data from **line number 10 to 20**  
  sed -n '10,20p' data.txt  

# **Inserting Text**  
- Insert text at the **2nd line**  
  sed '2i\I love India' data.txt  

- Insert text at the **last line**  
  sed '$a\I am from PSAIT' data.txt
  
#################  
User Management  
#################  

-> **Linux is a multi-user operating system.**  

-> Multiple users can access a single Linux machine and perform multitasking simultaneously.  

**Note:** In Amazon Linux virtual machines (VMs), the default user is **"ec2-user"**, which has **sudo** privileges.  

-> A single Linux machine can have multiple user accounts.  

-> When a user account is created, a home directory is automatically assigned.  

        admin   => /home/admin  
        mike    => /home/mike  
        stallin => /home/stallin 

# **Create a new user**  
  sudo useradd <username>  

# **Set or update a user's password**  
  sudo passwd <username>  

# **Display all created users**  
  cat /etc/passwd  

# **Switch to another user account**  
  su <username>  

# **Navigate to the current user's home directory**  
  cd ~  

# **Delete a user account**  
  sudo userdel <username>  

# **Delete a user along with their home directory**  
  sudo userdel --remove <username>  

# **Change a username**  
  sudo usermod -l <new-username> <old-username>  

# **Important system files related to users:**  
- `/etc/passwd` → Stores general user information.  
- `/etc/shadow` → Stores encrypted passwords and security-related data.  

##################################  
Managing User Groups in Linux  
##################################  

-> Groups allow administrators to assign permissions (read, write, execute) to multiple users at once instead of managing permissions for each user individually.
Example: A development team can be assigned to a "developers" group with access to project files.

-> Instead of modifying each user’s access manually, administrators can add or remove users from a group to grant or revoke access.
_____________________
Example Scenario
____________________
Imagine a company with multiple departments:

developers → Can access code repositories.
designers → Can access design assets.
finance → Can access financial reports.

By assigning users to the right groups, the company can ensure that employees only access the files they need.



-> When a new user is created in Linux, a **default user group** with the same name is also created.  

# **Display all groups in Linux**  
  cat /etc/group  

# **Create a new group**  
  sudo groupadd <group-name>  

# **Add a user to a group**  
  sudo usermod -aG <group-name> <username>  

# **Remove a user from a group**  
  sudo gpasswd -d <username> <group-name>  

# **List all users in a specific group**  
  getent group <group-name>  

# **Check which groups a user belongs to**  
  id <username>  

# **Delete a group**  
  sudo groupdel <group-name>  

# **Rename a group**  
  sudo groupmod -n <new-group-name> <old-group-name>
